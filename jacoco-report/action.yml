# In this workflow, we use a dedicated branch for storing the badges.
# It assumes that the badges branch already exists. That branch can otherwise
# be empty, as its only purpose is to store the coverage badges. Why? Well, if
# our main branch has required checks or reviews, the default GITHUB_TOKEN won't
# be able to push to it. By storing the badges in a dedicated branch, this is not
# an issue (just don't put any required checks or required reviews on the badges
# branch). Note that since we won't be storing anything else in the badges branch,
# we just put them in the root of that branch.
#
# IMPORTANT: Take note of the 2 checkout steps that are necessary for this variation.
# The first is the usual checkout step. The second checks out the dedicated badges branch
# (see the ref input) nested inside of the other in the path badges (see the path input).
# So locally within the rest of this workflow run, we'll have access to the badges branch
# within a badges directory.
#
# It does nothing if the badges branch doesn't exist.
